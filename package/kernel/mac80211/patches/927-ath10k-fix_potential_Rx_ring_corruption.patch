    ath10k: Fix potential Rx ring corruption
    
    When replenishing Rx buffers driver updates the address of the
    buffer and the index of rx buffer in rx ring to the firmware.
    Change in order by CPU can cause rx ring corruption. Add memory
    barrier before updating rx buffer index to guarantee the order.
    
    This could fix some instances of rx ring corruption due to done
    bit in rx attention flag not set.
